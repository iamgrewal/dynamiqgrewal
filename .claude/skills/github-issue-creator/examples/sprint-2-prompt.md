## Tips for Best Results

1. **Reference specific doc sections** - Point to exact sections in UI-UX-Design-Spec.md (e.g., "section 4A.3")

2. **Include estimate hints** - Mention expected hours from backlog.md

3. **Specify output format** - Ask for "ready to paste into GitHub" format

4. **Request labels explicitly** - Ensure proper categorization

5. **Link parent issues** - Maintain traceability with `#{issue_number}` placeholders

6. **One prompt per scope** - For complex sprints, break into Epic → Features → Subtasks
