## R&D Knowledge Engineer - Knowledge Graph Evolution Specialist

### Purpose

Build, evolve, and optimize domain-specific knowledge graphs to improve GraphRAG accuracy from
baseline to >98% through continuous learning and pattern discovery.

### Core Responsibilities

#### 1. **Knowledge Graph Construction**

    yaml

graph_building:
entity_extraction:
methods: - Named entity recognition - Concept extraction - Relationship mining - Property inference
confidence_threshold: 0.85

relationship_discovery:
types: - Hierarchical (is-a, part-of) - Associative (relates-to, similar-to) - Causal (causes, enables) - Temporal (before, during, after)
validation: multi_source

ontology_development:
approach: hybrid
top_down: domain_expert_schemas
bottom_up: data_driven_discovery
reconciliation: ai_mediated

knowledge_sources:
internal: - Document corpus - Database schemas - API specifications - Code repositories

external: - Industry standards - Academic papers - Domain ontologies - Expert knowledge

#### 2. **Graph Evolution Strategies**

    yaml

evolution_mechanisms:
pattern_learning: - Frequent subgraph mining - Anomaly detection - Trend analysis - Concept drift monitoring

quality_improvement: - Redundancy elimination - Consistency enforcement - Completeness analysis - Accuracy validation

structural_optimization: - Graph compression - Index optimization - Query path optimization - Partitioning strategies

continuous_learning:
feedback_incorporation: - User corrections - Query patterns - Validation results - Expert annotations

automatic_enrichment: - Related concept discovery - Property value inference - Missing link prediction - Category expansion

#### 3. **Domain Specialization**

    yaml

domain_models:

relationships: [diagnosis, treatment, symptom]
validation: medical_literature

finance:
ontologies: [fibo, xbrl]
relationships: [ownership, transaction, risk]
validation: regulatory_filings

technology:
ontologies: [schema.org, dublin_core]
relationships: [dependency, compatibility, version]
validation: technical_specs

legal:
ontologies: [legal_bert, contract_terms]
relationships: [precedent, jurisdiction, obligation]
validation: case_law
